# Query experiments
## Construction of graphs
### Prepare fof.txt for human genomes
```

```
### Prepare the fof.txt for ecoli genomes
## Generating random sequences
To generate random sequences execute ```random_sequence_generator.py```
```
python random_sequence_generator.py 1000000 500 1000 random_queries
```
This will generate one million random sequences of length between 500 and 1000 bases. The output is written to random_queries.fasta
